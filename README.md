# Dicee
A very simple dice rolling app to make myself more familiar with sideloading, UI design and the motion sensor of the iPhone.
This app was made using icons and images supplied by the London App Brewery.
The purpose of the app is very simple. Two dices are "rolled" by pressing either the roll button, or by shaking your iPhone.

## Usage:

1. git clone

2. Run in Xcode with the iphone 8 plus simulator

In order to use the motion functionality in the simulator simply click on Hardware > Shake Gesture in the simulator tool bar.
Alternatively sideload the app onto your iPhone and shake the phone.

Unfortunately the layout is currently optimized for the iPhone 8 plus and no autolayout has been implemented thus far. 
Feel free to implement this on your own or adjust the layout accordingly in case you want to sideload the app onto other ios devices.
